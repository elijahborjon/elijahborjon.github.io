            <p>
              I’m Elijah — a student researcher and musician who grew up translating: between Spanish
              and English, between adults and institutions, between complex systems and the people
              most affected by them. Medical forms, legal documents, and school emails came to our
              house in one language; my job was to turn them into something my family could act on.
            </p>
            <p>
              That role quietly shaped how I think about science and art. Research feels incomplete
              if the people it’s about can’t access it. Music feels incomplete if it doesn’t leave
              room for other people’s stories. So whether I’m writing about stress pathways in cancer
              or playing piano in a rehearsal room, I’m always thinking about translation and care.
            </p>
            <p>
              This website is a small snapshot of that work in progress: the projects that have taught
              me something, the images and sounds that stayed with me, and the questions I’m still
              trying to ask well.
