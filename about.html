    <p>
      I’m Elijah — a student researcher, musician, and person who has always lived in the space 
      between worlds. I grew up translating for my family: medical updates, legal notices, school 
      emails, anything that arrived in English but needed to be lived in Spanish. Those moments didn’t 
      feel heroic; they felt like survival. But they also became the root of how I think about knowledge: 
      if information can’t cross a barrier — linguistic, educational, or emotional — then it may as well 
      not exist. That belief still shapes everything I do. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Curiosity is my default setting. I’m the kid who once pulled apart a fallen strand of beard moss 
      just to figure out why a plant might need a tendon, freezing mid-trail with a damp white filament 
      stretched between my fingers and a dozen new questions unfurling in my head 
      <span class="cite">:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</span>. 
      That same instinct shows up now in research, in music, and in the way strangers somehow end up 
      telling me their life stories in grocery store lines. I think paying attention — to people, to 
      ecosystems, to patterns — is its own form of care.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my research, I follow the questions that tug at me, even when they look “meaningless” to 
      everyone else — like why a yoga study might downregulate a receptor involved in chronic stress 
      and cancer. Chasing those threads transformed my understanding of what it means to do science: 
      not to be the smartest person in the room, but the one willing to stay with a hard question until it 
      becomes clear enough for someone else to use 
      <span class="cite">:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Music is the other half of my education. Whether I’m at a piano, in a rehearsal room, or taking 
      photos from the sidelines of a lacrosse field, I’m always looking for the small human universes 
      inside a moment — the tired defender leaning on his long pole, the soft rustle of choir folders, 
      the breath before a downbeat. Art, like science, is translation: turning attention into something 
      that can be felt.
    </p>

    <p>
      And if I’m honest, the person who teaches me the most about attention lately is my girlfriend, 
      Nicoya. She’s the reminder that curiosity isn’t just an academic trait, but a relational one — a way 
      of noticing someone fully, of learning the textures of their world, of choosing wonder on purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website is a small snapshot of all of that: the questions I’m asking, the work I’m building, 
      the people and places that raised me, and the worlds I’m trying to translate with a little more care.
